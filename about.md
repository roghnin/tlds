# TLDS

TLDS provides a framework for developing transactional containers from lock-free ones.
Lock-free algorithms guarantee that the system makes progress in a finite number of steps, regardless of the system scheduler or actions of other threads.
TLDS provides a framework for developing transactional containers from lock-free ones. It includes three examples of transactional data structures: a list, a skip list, and a hash map. We are currently working on supporting transactional data structures for non-linked containers and also transactions that are executed on multiple containers.
