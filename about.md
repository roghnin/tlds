# TLDS

TLDS provides a framework for developing transactional containers from lock-free ones.
Lock-free algorithms guarantee that the system makes progress in a finite number of steps, regardless of the system scheduler or actions of other threads.
It includes five examples of transactional data structures, lock-free and obstruction-free versions of a linked list, and a skip list, and a lock-free hash map. We are currently working on supporting transactional data structures for non-linked containers and also transactions that are executed on multiple containers.
