        <h1>TLDS: Transactional Lock-free Data Structures</h1>

        <p class="lead">TLDS provides a framework for developing transactional containers from lock-free ones. It includes five examples of transactional data structures, lock-free and obstruction-free versions of a linked list, and a skip list, and a lock-free hash map. We are currently working on supporting transactional data structures for non-linked containers and also transactions that are executed on multiple containers.

        <h3>Lock-Free</h3>
        <p>
        Lock-free algorithms guarantee that the system makes progress in a finite number of steps, regardless of the system scheduler or actions of other threads. This property is critical for real-time systems.
        </p>

        <h3>Framework</h3>
        <p>
        As a framework, TLDS provides a way to transform hand-crafted lock-free data structures into transactional ones. This transformation degrades neither the progress nor correctness guarantees. </p>

        <h3>Examples</h3>
        <p>
        TLDS provides five transactional data structures as examples of its transformation approach.
