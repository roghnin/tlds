\section{Composable Data Structure}

Concurrent library is prevalent. However linearizability is not preserved under method composition, hence annihilating reusability~\cite{gramoli2013composing}.

STM has two problems: 1) it supports composition but sacrifices performance; 2) in pursuit of performance, relaxed STM systems are proposed, but they may hamper composability.
