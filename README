Transactional Operations for Linked Data Structures

This repository contains the code for "Lock-free Transactions without Rollbacks for Linked Data Structures."

This code is extended by "TxContainers: A Library of Wait-Free Transactional Data Structures Without Rollbacks"
The code for TxContainers will be posted here upon acceptance of the paper.

To build the code do the following:
git clone https://github.com/ucf-cs/tlds
mv tlds trans-dev
cd trans-dev
./bootstrap.sh
cd ../trans-compile
../trans-dev/configure
make -j8    #-j followed by a number runs make with that many threads
./src/trans  #this runs the tester without any options
